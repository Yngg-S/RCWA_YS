# RCWA_YS
RCWA implementation in python:

This is one of my hobby projects and V1.0 is the start point. 
The goal is to play with those semi-analytical methods in modeling the device in python and have fun. The implementation is mostly following Dr. Raymond Rumpf's lecture and Dr. Moharam's paper (both are from UCF).


My plan is to make this code work for spatial-variant and anisotropic devices.      


V1.0:

Current version 1.0 works for isotropic matrerials and allows parameter sweeping (incident angles, wavelength, device geometry, etc. ).

Everything was put into one .py file. I know it is not a good practice in general, but for now(less than 500 lines of code ), it appears easier to dubug in this form :)


Have fun!
